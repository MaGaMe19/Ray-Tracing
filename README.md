# Python Ray Tracing

Simple ray tracer (pathtracer) coded in python based on [Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#addingasphere).

This script requires tqdm to be installed. Install it using `pip install tqdm`.

I saved some images of the progress of the ray tracer in the `/images` directory. The name of the image corresponds to the chapter, after which I generated that image.
