# Ray Tracing in Java

Simple ray tracer (pathtracer) coded in Java based on [Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#addingasphere).

_I originally coded everything in Python but that was too slow, which is why I ported everything to Java after chapter 8.4._

_The python script requires tqdm to be installed. Install it using `pip install tqdm`._

I saved some images of the progress of the ray tracer in the `/images` directory. The name of the image corresponds to the chapter, after which I generated that image.
